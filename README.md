# KEP-BPMDD
A branch-and-price algorithm enhanced by multi-valued decision diagrams (BPMDD) for the kidney exchange problem (KEP)

This algorithm and implementation is presented in the following publication:

Riascos-√Ålvarez, Lizeth Carolina, Merve Bodur, and Dionne M. Aleman. "A branch-and-price algorithm enhanced by decision diagrams for the kidney exchange problem." arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.13715 (2020). <https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13715>

The program is implemented in C++ and includes several test instances of varying compatibility graph sizes and properties.
